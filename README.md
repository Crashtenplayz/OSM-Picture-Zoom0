# Open Street Map Picture (Zoom 0)

This project generates images at ZOOM 0 from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM) data. Users can download the produced pictures directly from this repository.

## Details
- Map source: OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- Zoom: 0
- Format: PNG

## How to use

- Folder and filename meaning:
  - The first folder name is X (a number).
  - The PNG filename (without extension) is Y (a number).
  - In other words: first folder means X; second (PNG) means Y.

- Paths and coordinates (Zoom 0, 2×2 tiles):
  - Valid X: 0 or 1
  - Valid Y: 0 or 1
  - Examples:
    - `1/1.png` → X=1, Y=1
    - `1/2.png` → X=1, Y=2

- Grid layout (how to stitch the 2×2 image):
  - X increases to the right; Y increases downward
  - Arrange tiles like this (Examples):
    - Top-left: `1/1.png`
    - Top-right: `2/1.png`
    - Bottom-left: `1/2.png`
    - Bottom-right: `2/2.png`

- Downloading:
  - Browse the repository folders and click the PNG you need to download.

- Using the images:
  - You can place the four tiles in a 2×2 grid (as listed above) to form the full Zoom 0 view.
